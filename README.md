## Overview

The Disaster Tweets Classification NLP project is an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as either disaster-related or not. It aims to identify tweets that contain information about real disasters, helping organizations and authorities respond more effectively during emergencies.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets as either disaster-related or non-disaster-related. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of tweets, and it leverages NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of tweets that are labeled as disaster-related or non-disaster-related. It contains the following columns:

- `text`: The text content of the tweet.
- `target`: The target label, where 1 indicates a disaster-related tweet, and 0 indicates a non-disaster-related tweet.

Please note that the dataset used for this project is not provided within this repository due to licensing restrictions. You can use your own labeled dataset or obtain a suitable dataset from various sources.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (or keras)
- nltk
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disaster-Tweets-Classification-NLP.git
cd Disaster-Tweets-Classification-NLP
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with `text` and `target` columns. Modify the data loading part in the code if your dataset has different column names.

2. Preprocess the text data: Apply necessary preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, removing stopwords, etc.

3. Train the model: Run the training script to build and train the NLP model.

4. Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Model

The NLP model used for this project is a deep learning-based classifier, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is chosen for its ability to capture sequential patterns in text data effectively.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the project! If you find any bugs or want to add new features, please create a pull request, and we'll review it together.
